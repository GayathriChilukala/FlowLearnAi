git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowlearn-ai.git
cd flowlearn-ai
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Enter any topic you want to learn
4. Select your complexity level
5. Watch the AI-generated flowchart come to life with guided narration!

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students and professionals struggle to understand complex processes, algorithms, and systems. Traditional learning materials often:
- Present information in static, linear formats
- Lack visual representation of relationships
- Don't adapt to different skill levels
- Fail to engage learners with interactive content

**82% of learners** report better retention with visual + auditory learning compared to text alone.

## 💡 Our Solution: FlowLearn AI

FlowLearn AI revolutionizes how people learn complex topics by:

### 🤖 AI-Powered Generation
- **GPT-4 Integration** via GitHub Models API for intelligent flowchart creation
- **Adaptive Complexity** - Three levels tailored to learner's expertise:
  - **Simple** (5-7 steps): Quick overview for beginners
  - **Detailed** (8-12 steps): Balanced depth with decision points
  - **Advanced** (12-15 steps): Technical depth with loops and edge cases

### 🎨 Interactive Visual Learning
- **Animated Guided Tours** with synchronized visual highlighting
- **AI Teacher Avatar** providing contextual explanations
- **Voice Narration** with adjustable speed (0.75x - 1.5x)
- **Sub-step Breakdowns** for complex concepts
- **Real-time Visual Tracking** showing current position in the process

### 📥 Multi-Format Export
Supporting 7 different export formats for maximum accessibility:
- **Images:** PNG, JPG, SVG (for presentations)
- **Documents:** PDF, DOCX (for reports)
- **Data:** JSON, Mermaid code (for developers)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend:** Pure JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4 via GitHub Models API
- **Visualization:** Mermaid.js for flowchart rendering
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Voice Synthesis:** Web Speech API
- **Export Libraries:** 
  - html2canvas (image capture)
  - jsPDF (PDF generation)
  - docx.js (Word documents)

### Architecture
```

```

### Key Features Implementation

#### 1. Intelligent Prompt Engineering
```javascript
// Ensures perfect flowchart generation with node-step synchronization
const prompt = `Create a ${complexity} flowchart with:
- Syntactically perfect Mermaid code
- Every node matched to detailed explanations
- Sub-steps for complex operations
- Appropriate complexity based on level`;
```

#### 2. Dynamic Visual Tracking
```javascript
// Real-time pointer positioning and highlighting
function movePointerToNode(nodeId) {
    // Calculates exact position
    // Adds pulsing highlight ring
    // Smooth scroll into view
}
```

#### 3. Adaptive Timing System
```javascript
// Intelligent pacing based on content length
const waitTime = Math.max(3500, text.length * 42);
```
